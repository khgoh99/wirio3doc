# Industrial IoT Remote I/O

Model Number: RP2-1204M

12 Bidirectional Opto-isolated input channel, 4 Relay Contact Output Channel equiped with Modbus slave interface.

Enclusure is Water/Dust resistance. Please take note that to prevent the water/dust to leak into the enclosure, please make sure that the wire going through the wire gland is having outter dimeter between 6.5mm to 11mm (PG13.5) and 4mm to 8mm(PG9).

# System Feature

- Connection is from device connected to server.
- Once system power up, it will auto create a persistence connection to the server without user intervention.
- Server can be placed either at public cloud, private cloud or LAN.
- Device able to work behind firewall.
- Modbus Slave Interface support multiple range of Baudrate.

## Network link with MQTT Broker Server

- Open Standard protocol and readily available either using paid version or free version of  MQTT Broker.
- Messaging format based on JSON format.
- JSON messaging format is supported by various programming language and easily integrated to any existing system.
- Device support Secure WebSocket or Secure TCP connection to MQTT Broker.

## Auto fetch real time clock from Internet Time Server.

- Auto connect with the Internet Time Server to fetch the Real time value (EPOC Time) when network is connected and internet link is available.
- Manually set time by server if internet link is not available.
- Auto readjust the time drift periodically.
- Append the EPOC time to all the message.

## Easy setup and configuration

- System configures with Android Apps.
- Provide detail device properties, E.g., model number, version number, etc.
- Connectivity selection either using Wi-Fi and/or Modbus RTU Slave.
- MQTT Server IP/Domain Name Setup.
- DHCP/Fix IP.
- Internet Time Server Setting.

## Other

- Water/Dust resistance enclosure.
- Support wide supply input voltage, 12V DC to 24V DC.
- All terminal block connector is detachable for easy installation.
- External water/dust resistance link indicator and configuration push button.
- External configuration push button can be disabled.
